  <h3>Health</h3>
  <p>Veganism is great for health because it helps prevent numerous diseases for example cardiovascular disease and cholesterol. <br>
  It is also easier to have a nutritious lifestyle wsith vagn diets often being low in saturated fats and being high in fibre and vitamins.<br>
  Vegan lifestyles often leads to added benefits such as stronger hair, nails, reduced menstrual pains and increased weight loss.<br>

  <h3>Environment</h3>
  <p>Animal agriculture is the leading cause to the deforestation of the Amazon rainforest and uses 3/4 of the worlds water supply.<br>
  By becoming vegan people are reducing their carbon footprint, the amount of greenhouse gases they contribute to the atmosphere and the environment. <br>
   Vegans also require less land for their diets than meats (less than three times the amount) and therefore contribute to a more sustainable living. </p>

  <h3>Compassion</h3>
  <p>Imagine being born into the world for the sole purpose of becoming food for another species. But imagine also having terrible living conditions,<br>
  being crammed with others like you, be fed to be fat (like Hansel and Gretel) and never be allowed out to enjoy grass and what comes naturally to you.<br>
  Then imagine being slaughtered and cooked to be food. That is a cruel existence. Billions of animals are slaughtered each year to become food. <br>
  Animals that all feel pain, want to feel love and want to live. Animals are a lot like humans in many ways, for example did you know that cows <br>
  have best friends and can get depressed when away from them. Did you also know that pigs are known to be just as smart as dogs if not more than. <br> </p>
